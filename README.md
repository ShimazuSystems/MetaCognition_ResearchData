# **MetaCognition \- Chatlog Dataset**

This repository contains a dataset of conversation logs generated by **MetaCognition**, a prototype AI system designed to simulate a multi-stage cognitive process for analyzing complex queries. These logs are provided in a structured JSON format to facilitate research into advanced AI reasoning, cognitive architectures, and the behavior of large language models within procedural frameworks.

## **About MetaCognition**

MetaCognition is an experimental architecture built to move beyond simple, single-shot responses. Instead of answering a query directly, it guides a large language model (LLM) through a structured thought process. Its key components include:

* **Multi-Stage Reasoning Pipeline**: The engine deconstructs a query, analyzes it from multiple perspectives (e.g., critical, technical, philosophical), and then synthesizes a final conclusion. The path taken can vary in depth (moderate, deep, exhaustive).  
* **Working Memory (memory.js)**: A stateful, capacity-constrained module that simulates cognitive focus. It uses an attention mechanism to prioritize relevant information and let unimportant details decay over time.  
* **Emergent Layer (emergent-layer.js)**: A meta-cognitive safety net that monitors the reasoning process. If it detects circular logic, low confidence, or high uncertainty, it can intervene by generating a novel prompt to reframe the problem and unlock new insights.  
* **Context Parser (context-parser.js)**: A utility that extracts structured information (like insights, assumptions, and evidence) from the LLM's unstructured text responses, allowing the system to build upon its own conclusions iteratively.
* **& more!**: This list is far from exhaustive, the code is *extensive*.

The goal of this architecture is to produce more transparent, robust, and auditable reasoning, where the final answer is supported by a traceable line of analytical steps.

## **Dataset Description**

The data in this repository consists of JSON files, where each file represents a complete, self-contained reasoning session. The filenames are structured as \[topic\]\_deep-reasoning-\[sessionId\]-\[date\].json.

These files capture not just the final user-AI conversation but the entire internal "thought process" of the engine, including the intermediate outputs from each reasoning stage, session settings, and final memory states.

## **JSON File Structure**

Each JSON file has a root object with the following key properties. Understanding this structure is essential for analysis.

| Key | Type | Description |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| id | String | The unique identifier for the session. |
| name | String | The user-assigned name for the session, often based on the initial query. |
| messages | Array | An array of message objects, representing the complete conversational history. |
| reasoningDepth | String | The reasoning mode used for the session (e.g., exhaustive). |
| allowEmergentReasoning | Boolean | A flag indicating whether the Emergent Layer was enabled for the session. |
| reasoningMetadata | Object | An object containing a high-level summary of the final reasoning task's performance. |
| lastReasoningTrace | Array | An array of objects detailing the step-by-step execution of the final reasoning task. **This** is the most **valuable field for research.** |
| workingMemory | Object | A snapshot of the final state of the WorkingMemory module for the session. |
| personality | Object | An object containing personality parameters for the AI (e.g., skepticism). |
| aiName | String | The name chosen by the AI for the session, if enabled. |
| aiEmotion | String | An HSL color value representing the AI's sentiment, if enabled. |
| createdAt | String | An ISO 8601 timestamp for when the session was created. |

### **The messages Object**

Each object in the messages array represents a turn in the conversation.

```
{  
  "id": "unique-message-id",  
  "sender": "user", // or "ai"  
  "type": "message",  
  "content": "The text content of the message.",  
  "timestamp": "2025-07-26T18:01:21.367Z",  
  "model": "gemini-2.5-flash", // For AI messages  
  "metadata": { ... }, // For AI messages  
  "reasoningTrace": \[ ... \] // For AI messages  
}
```

### **The lastReasoningTrace Array**

This is the core of the dataset. It's an array where each object represents one step in the engine's cognitive pipeline.

```
"lastReasoningTrace": \[  
  {  
    "stage": "decomposition",  
    "result": "\#\# Main Question\\n\[...\]\\n\\n\#\# Key Concepts\\n\[...\]",  
    "timestamp": "2025-07-26T18:01:25.008Z",  
    "conceptsExtracted": 5,  
    "workingMemoryState": {  
      "capacity": "5/7",  
      "topConcepts": \[...\]  
    }  
  },

    "result": "\[EMERGENT INSIGHT\] The core issue is not technical but procedural...",  
    "timestamp": "2025-07-26T18:01:40.000Z",  
    "triggers": \[

    }  
  }

* **triggers**: (Only in emergent-reasoning) An array detailing what caused the Emergent Layer to activate.
